## Executive Summary & Recommendation


Dear Company,

After extensive research, it is concluded that your company's net revenue would be optimized at seven docks. We came to this conclusion by conducting performance testing that included each dock possibility in 1000 random test cases. The factors that were taken into consideration were: 

1. Number of docks
2. Longest line throughout the day
3. Trucks/crates processed
4. Time in/not in use
5. Cost of operation
6. Net revenue (being the most important)

With four or less docks, the lines were becoming too long, though money is saved on cost of operation, more is lost by not processing the trucks. On the opposite end of the spectrum, any amount of docks over fifteen will decrease wait time for trucks to zero, but raise the cost of operation substantially. Any raise of operation reduces amount of profit for the company.

By continuing these constraints with testing, we concluded that seven is the most profitable. The trucks had barely any wait time, allowing more trucks to be processed at around 23 per day. Seven docks also didn't have too many docks to drive up cost of operation, with an average cost per day being $13,000. The time in use was the most consistent of any number 1-15, with around 130 time increments. The culmination of these optimized factors had seven docks producing the highest net revenue at around $12,900 and an average of $8,721 on a 1,000 test case average.
